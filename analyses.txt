SUMMARY
-------------------------
The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as latitude changes. To this end, Data from over 500 random cities was pulled from the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap API</a>.
After assembling the dataset, Matplotlib was used to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Chiefly: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.

MAX TEMPERATURE
-------------------------
It is common knowledge that temperature is warmer towards the equator. Imagine Colombia and Somalia then imagine Greenland and Antarctica. So as expected, there is a high positive correlation (r = +0.70) between temperature and latitude in the southern hemisphere, and an even higher negative correlation (r = -0.85) between temperature and latitude in the northern hemisphere. The correlations themselves are expected. The interesting part is the difference of the magnitudes of the correlations.
There are far more datapoints available in the Northern hemisphere where there is far more habitable land. To illustrate this point, the latitude axis in the northern hemisphere data has a range of about 80 while the latitude in the southern hemisphere data has a range of about 55. Notice the hyperbolic shape of the datapoints; It may be that if more cities extended to the south, the trend would curve downward moving left on the graph as it does moving right, and equalize the linear correlations.
In terms of geography, it may also be that the linear correlation is slightly lower on the left than the right because the correct division of the hemispheres is not exactly 0 degrees latitude as assumed in the calculation of r, but rather somewhere around -5 degrees because of the tilt of the Earth at the time of the data retrieval.

WIND SPEED
-------------------------
There is no discernible correlation between wind speed and latitude according to this analysis. It does seem, however, that the extreme windy cities are exclusively above a latitude of 40 degrees. Then again, that is also where the datapoints are most frequent. Ergo, a half dozen datapoints are not enough to draw any conclusions.
Even if it was granted that high latitudes have an apparent correlation with high windspeed, datapoints are concentrated in the north to the point where there are only a dozen or so datapoints south of -40 degrees latitude. For that reason, certainly no conclusions can be drawn about the southern hemisphere and it cannot be said that “extreme latitudes” correlate with windspeed in cities.

HUMIDITY
-------------------------
Thinking of the tropical countries of Central America or Southeast Asia, one might expect that latitudes closer to the equator would have much higher humidity. However, this plot shows that there is a very weak positive correlation, at best, between humidity and latitude (r < 0.3). Below is a possible psychological and scientific explanation.
As shown on the <a href="temp.html">max temperature visualization</a>, there is a strong correlation between latitude and temperature (further from the equator is generally colder). It may be that it is the combination of heat, humidity, and tropical weather, rather than hard statistics, that give tropical countries their humid reputation.
Outside of the psychological explanation for the disparity between expectations and reality, it is important to note that the data gathered is for relative humidity rather than absolute humidity. Cold northern air can hold far less moisture than hot tropical air. This means that the same amount of absolute humidity will generally cause much higher relative humidity as the air is further north (colder).

CLOUDINESS
-------------------------
Of all the variables compared with latitude, cloudiness seems to have the least to say. Neither hemisphere has even a weak correlation (north: |r| < .2, south: |r| < .3). On top of that, there weren’t any expectations going in.
